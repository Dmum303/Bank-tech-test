<!-- This is an app in which a user is able to create a transaction to desposit or withdraw funds from
their bank account. It will then produce a statement reflecting the account's activity.
There is a class for the transaction: transaction.js and the bank account which will produce the statement:
bank.js. Each class has it's own test suit and there is a intergration test to check real world applicability. -->
